# Smart-Fruit-Ripeness-Detection-System
It is an automated solution designed to accurately assess fruit ripeness and quality while overcoming the limitations of traditional manual inspection methods, which are subjective and time-consuming. The system uses a camera module mounted on a rotator to capture fruit images from multiple angles, ensuring complete surface coverage. These images are processed using edge detection and deep learning techniques, where a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) analyzes visual features such as color, texture, and defects to classify fruits as healthy, ripe, or rotten.

Along with image-based analysis, the system monitors environmental and biochemical factors that affect fruit freshness. A DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity in real time, while an MQ-3 gas sensor detects ethanol vapors released during fruit ripening and spoilage. An Arduino Uno integrates sensor data with CNN predictions, and the final results are transmitted to the cloud and displayed on a mobile or web application, enabling real-time monitoring and informed decision-making.
